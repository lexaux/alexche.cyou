this life. I am Ukrainian 🇺🇦.

fixing, please let me know.</p><h2 id=consulting>Consulting</h2><p>I was one of the two active founders At <a href=https://clutch.co/profile/logicify#summary>Logicify</a>.
We got off the ground, built up and sold a 40-strong services business with zero
external investments on a tiny local market. There were tons of lessons learned,
and sometimes I do miss that adventurous time.</p><p>Happy to see how to help with:</p><ul><li>Building strong leadership and engineering teams</li><li>Marketing and sales in software service sector</li><li>Working with offshore vendors and outsourcing providers</li><li>Hiring and retaining talent in Eastern Europe</li><li>Acting as an interim CTO</li><li>Doing tech advisory for startups</li></ul><p>Get in touch for a friendly chat. I view consulting as a nice to have side gig
yielding a stream of atypical and rather complex problems, and I&rsquo;m spending
just a bit of time in it.</p><h2 id=support-ukraine->Support Ukraine 🇺🇦</h2><p>Every single bit helps. People of Ukraine need a lot of support due to unprovoked and
unprecedented ongoing aggression of the Russian Federation.</p><p>There is now a consolidated entry point to provide help via <a href=https://u24.gov.ua>https://u24.gov.ua</a>.</p><p>There is also a full spectre of organisations and groups available. Ask me if you need
guidance. Ukrainian volunteering movement is something amazing yet to be studied and
published in books. A self-organizing system helping fill the gaps and get things done where
they are needed most.</p><p>As a rule of thumb I personally try to split donations across levels:</p><ul><li>Large funds like <a href=https://prytulafoundation.org/en>Prytula Foundation</a> or
<a href=https://savelife.in.ua/en/>SaveLife</a> can get bigger things done and help on the level
of brigade or regiment.</li><li>Mid-size funds like <a href=https://www.koloua.com/en>Kolo</a> which fill the gaps.</li><li>Going ad-hoc and down to the individual level. If you happen to know someone
personally, or you know someone who knows someone who needs a sight, a scope, or a pair of warm gloves,
helping them directly is often the best way to go. Be prepared however that it might be more
complex than just sending money - oftentimes people need concrete things not cash. Feel
free to ask me about details.</li></ul></section></article></main><footer class="opaco mx-auto flex h-[5rem] max-w-3xl items-center px-8 text-[0.9em] opacity-60"><div class=mr-auto>&copy; 2022
