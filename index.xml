I am an experienced engineering leader and entrepreneur with interests ranging between improving people&amp;rsquo;s life, making business more productive, and doing that all with tech.
So far I had a career in services industry going from line roles in software engineering to team leadership, been getting off the ground three startups, built and exited out of my software services company. I&amp;rsquo;m always looking for opportunities to make an impact.</description></item></channel></rss>
