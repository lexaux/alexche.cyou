I am an experienced engineering leader and entrepreneur with interests ranging between improving people&amp;rsquo;s lives, making business more productive, and doing that all with tech.
So far I have had a career in services industry going from line roles in software engineering to team leadership, participated in three early-stage startups, built and exited out of my software services company.
I love my family and enjoy spending time with them.</description></item></channel></rss>
