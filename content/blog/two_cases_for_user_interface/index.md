### Case: Currency Exchange

I am in Toronto, Canada now. In addition to banks changing money, there are a few companies providing this service. Core value is money - they just do it with better rates. There are two big players on this market of FX companies. Both of them provide same type of value but in a very different way. First is more traditional - you book transactions via call, speak to your account manager, you don't have an app. Second is more modern: self-registration, automated KYC with ID check, mobile app to exchange money.

Again, the core value they provide is same: better rates than banks. I am buying a car for cash, these guys guys give me CAD $1000 out of thin air when compared to high street bank, quite an incentive to use them? 

But the interface can also impact value itself. 

Naturally, I would prefer the self-service, app approach. You can book transactions on the go. You can see how it progresses. There is no need to wait on the line to get to speak to your account manager. 

There are, however, benefits of old-fashioned service as well. You can negotiate (always when speaking with a live person!). A friend of mine, client of such old-fashioned FX firm, got an advice from his account manager to wait for a week with exchange, as regulator was expected to raise base rate and he would have gotten better off, if not in a rush. Something which would be hard to do with an app, right? 

### Case: Smart Home

Smart home can be approached in different ways. It certainly has a potential to provide value to the customer: from basic things like controlling your blinds with a voice command to dimming the light from your phone to regular scheduled automations. 

There is a myriad of approaches of interfacing with smart home: tablet panels, voice commands and feedback, physical buttons, smartphone app controls and so on. If you look at the ads of smart home appliances, oftentimes it is it - there are pictures of nice apps with lists and buttons and icons and so on. 

There is, however, another interface which is often omitted. Lack of it. Just think about it: 

* User does not want to flip a switch. They want their light to be on to read in bed before they sleep.
* User does not want to rotate a virtual knob to dim light (oh my!). They want to be able to find their way to toilet at night without being blinded. 
* User does not want to constantly tick the thermostat up and down. They just want to feel comfy. 

And the list goes on. Core value does not demand an interface. It is just that we do not have a better means than put this on to the user, and get their inputs from interface, to provide that. 

This thought struck me when Dmitry Berezovsky was showcasing me his smart home, what would then become Jointbox. It was full of automations, very specific to his lifestyle. And eventually it just worked in such a way that he did not have to pull out his phone all the time to control bits and pieces.
