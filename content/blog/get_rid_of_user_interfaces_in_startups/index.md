I would like to urge early-stage startup founders to stop investing into, spending time on, putting efforts into **User Inteface**.

This sounds controversial, as it is meant to be thought-provoking. In this little essay I will try to think about the concept of UI and value, and how the situation is specific for early-stage startups. For disclaimers, I will narrow 'early-stage' to the small startups bootstrapping, or on a short runway, still finding that product-market fit. Specially for the cases where the resource is limited and approach calls to be lean.

## My Bias 

I am a software engineer by training, and most of my life I have been creating software. Moreover, majority of it was work-made-for-hire, and also work made for startups.

At [Logicify](https://clutch.co/profile/logicify#summary) times we worked a lot with bootstrapped, resource-short startups. We were mostly engaged as a software vendor, building joint teams with them on a journey to deliver technology necessary to find the fit and then deliver startup mission. While we were closer to tech provider, we often participated in product-level functions, forming a kind of 'synthetic product function' across the founders and our tech guys. 

By all means, being a technologist and engineer, I should have called for building more good tech making life easier. But I am arguing for exactly the opposite case. 

Ditch the UI, or at least de-prioritize it. 

# Business and Value
![Business and Value Relationship](customer-value.svg)

- Customer --access--> Value
- Value Exchanges for money (typically). This is revenue.
- Case #1. Currency exchange (knightsbridge fx and remitbee)
- Case #2. Smart home.

# Tech Startups and Value

- Customer --> UI --> Value
- UI: enabler or obstacle? 

# Early stage: product-market fit search

- Goal is to validate that there is enough traction to build further business
- Founders can stretch to cover the gaps. Automated signups might not be needed. 
- Runway is spent on research and learning from the market. 
- Lean: runway is smnall, resource is scarce, force to be effective and do only what's important. 
- What is the most impactful thing one can do today? 

# User Interface

- UI is expensive to build, even with all the codeless stuff. Needs testing, consistency, adherence to standards, 
- UI is wide: you typically need to support different devices (or make tradeoffs). Android, or 
- UI quality itself is a hygienic factor for user. It is unlikely to make them happy, but it can make them leave unhappy. Disclaimer: for some products, UI might be the core value factor (disrupting the old market with a nice UI)
- UI is a code. Code is a liability (maintenance, ownerhsip, cost, etc)
- Is UI an enabler or obstacle then?

# User Interface as an Obstacle: Example 

Let this just soak in: 

- You do not want to be writing and sending emails, even less so checking. You want to be able to get messages and information across conveniently.  
- When boiling your pasta, you do not want to be spinning number wheels or keying in data. You just want your pasta al-dente, or at least a notification when it is so you can drain it. 
- You probably do not want to fill in a ton of forms and fields, and make a ton of micro-decisions with tradeoffs. You would rather have a simple, understandable subscription to roll in to (preferable single click with G Payment)

You see where this is going? For each of these cases, users often find a way around. I am sharing my workarounds:

- Emails and communications: Sometimes it is much easier to setup a c- Sometimes it is much easier to setup a call, saves 100 emails back and force. Each of us has been in a situation when 'enough of this bouncegame'.  
- Pasta-boiling: Physical, pomodoro-style timer, or 'Hey Siri, timer 10 minutes' makes pasta-boiling easier
- Subscription: If things are complex with subscription, I would often call someone to guide me through, and put the cognitive load on them. I am going to buy a service from company, and they know their product and service line better, why not?

This is why customer support is still a big thing. Whenever I'm feeling friction with the tech, I'd rather early switch to a customer support. I'd switch back to tech if support quality is low and wait is long. 

# Product-Market Fit Startups Again 

Putting the above into the context of lean, resource-stranded startup in product-market fit phase, things become even worse. 

So, as a startup, you would need to divert substantial amount of resource from the core value, and also create a subpar experience for the customers. This also complicates things in a time domain: UI needs support and change just as any other code. All this activity is falling way below the optimal impact/investment treshold. 

But what can we do? Is there a way to build a tech startup without an interface? 

This is a thought-provoking essay. I am not giving away any answers here, just asking you to think about this topic. What can be done to limit the spend on UI? Can something pre-existing be used? Can you start with a typeform, email and phone service to test the hypothesis?
