## Bio 

**Hello and nice to meet you.** I am an experienced engineering leader and entrepreneur 
with interests ranging between improving people's lives, making business more 
productive, and doing that all with tech.

So far I have had a career in services industry going from line roles in software 
engineering to team leadership, participated in three early-stage startups, built and exited 
out of my software services company.

 I love my family and enjoy spending time with them. I also like reading, hiking and 
 reflecting on this life.
 
I am Ukrainian 🇺🇦. I currently live in Canada 🇨🇦.

## Resume

I am not looking for employment at the moment. However, whether you are looking to hire me, or just interested, there are two tracks I anticipate: 

* [Resume: Engineering Leadership and Management](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1itWIwHYUlxGa0qP2VDAvMPZA9hjU_R00D6ES5je1Y08/edit#)
* [Resume: Software Engineering](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tyH_jeOm9-XTKYIPrxEHNpMrre_TPDXSveZtwFVvF18/edit#)

The documents are open for commenting, so if you just stopped by and see something worth
fixing, please let me know. 

## Consulting and Advisory

I was one of the two active founders At [Logicify](https://clutch.co/profile/logicify#summary). 
We got off the ground, built up and sold a services business. Zero 
external investments, on a tiny local market. Team of 40 as of exit. There were tons of
lessons learned, and sometimes I do miss that adventurous time.

Happy to see how to help with: 

* Building strong leadership and engineering teams
* Marketing and sales in software service sector
* Working with offshore vendors and outsourcing providers 
* Hiring and retaining talent in Eastern Europe
* Acting as an interim CTO
* Doing tech advisory for startups

Get in touch for a friendly chat. I view consulting as a nice to have side gig 
yielding a stream of atypical and rather complex problems, and I'm spending 
just a bit of time in it.


## Support Ukraine 🇺🇦 

Every single bit helps. People of Ukraine need a lot of support due to unprovoked and 
unprecedented ongoing aggression of the Russian Federation. 

There is now a consolidated entry point to provide help via https://u24.gov.ua. 

There is also a full spectre of organisations and groups available. Ask me if you need 
guidance. Ukrainian volunteering movement is something amazing yet to be studied and 
published in books. A self-organizing system helping fill the gaps and get things done where
they are needed most. 

As a rule of thumb I personally try to split donations across levels:

* Large funds like [Prytula Foundation](https://prytulafoundation.org/en) or 
[SaveLife](https://savelife.in.ua/en/) can get bigger things done and help on the level
of brigade or regiment. 
* Mid-size funds like [Kolo](https://www.koloua.com/en) which fill the gaps. 
* Going ad-hoc and down to the individual level. If you happen to know someone 
personally, or you know someone who knows someone who needs a sight, a scope, or a pair of warm gloves, 
helping them directly is often the best way to go. Be prepared however that it might be more
complex than just sending money - oftentimes people need concrete things not cash. Feel
free to ask me about details.
