**Hello and nice to meet you.** I am an experienced engineering leader and entrepreneur 
with interests ranging between improving people's life, making business more 
productive, and doing that all with tech.

So far I had a career in services industry going from line roles in software engineering
to team leadership, been getting off the ground three startups, built and exited out of my software services 
company. I'm always looking for opportunities to make an impact. 

On the personal side of things, I love my family, reading, hiking, and reflecting on this life.

## Resume

Whether you are looking to hire me, or just interested, there are two tracks I anticipate: 

* [Engineering Leadership and Management](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1itWIwHYUlxGa0qP2VDAvMPZA9hjU_R00D6ES5je1Y08/edit#)

The documents are open for commenting, so if you just stopped by and see something worth
fixing, please let me know. 

## Consulting

At [Logicify](https://clutch.co/profile/logicify#summary), I was one of the two active founders, and we got off the ground, 
built up and sold a 40-strong services business with zero external investments on a tiny 
local market. There were tons of lessons learned and sometimes I do miss that adventurous time.

Happy to see how to help with: 

* Building strong leadership and engineering teams
* Marketing and sales in software service companies
* Working with offshore vendors and outsourcing providers 
* Hiring and keeping talent in Eastern Europe
* Acting as an interim CTO or tech advisor for a startup

Get in touch for a friendly chat. I see consulting as a nice to have side gig 
yielding a stream of atypical and rather complex problems, and I'm spending 
just a bit of time in it.
